The term RFID (radio frequency identification) is one type of electronic device includes a small antenna and a chip. This device is used to transmit the information like persons, animals, books or any stuff between reader and RFID tag using radio frequency electromagnetic fields. It is capable of carrying 2k bytes of data.
WORKING:
Initialization:
●	Set up the necessary components, including the Arduino board, RFID reader module, LCD display, and connecting wires.
●	Initialize the required libraries and modules in the Arduino code.
RFID Card Enrollment Process:
●	Present a new RFID card or tag to the RFID reader.
●	Capture the unique identifier (UID) of the RFID card using the RFID reader.
●	Store the UID in the system, associating it with the user's information, such as name, ID, or other relevant details.
●	This process is typically performed during the initial setup to register users in the attendance system.
RFID Card Verification Process:
●	During the attendance check, a user presents their RFID card to the RFID reader.
●	The RFID reader captures the UID of the presented card.
Decision-Making for Attendance Marking:
●	Once the user is identified, the system checks whether the user is already marked as present or absent.
●	If the user is marked as absent, the system marks them as present and updates the attendance record.
Attendance management is one of the most crucial tasks in an educational institution- school, college, or university. Daily student attendance allows teachers to keep a tab on students’ activities.
An RFID-based attendance system makes use of RFID technology to mark student’s attendance before every lecture in the institute. The students have to use an RFID tag to mark their presence on the RFID reader. The data is stored in the attendance system with high accuracy and efficiency. It can be used by faculty members for further operations.
An RFID based attendance system can be a great solution to overcome such challenges as it automates the students’ attendance process & enables teachers and parents to track & monitor students’ activities effortlessly.
